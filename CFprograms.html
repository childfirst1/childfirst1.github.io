<h1>Did you know?</h1>

<p>Children may attend our summer program the year that they begin Kindergarten. </p>

<p>This is a great way for Kinders to meet schoolmates and transition to their very important first year of school.</p>

<p>At Childfirst, older children often take initiative to act as kind leaders and help younger children who are new to the program!</p>


<h1>Snacks</h1>


<img src="images/fruits.jpg" width="270" height="180" alt="snacks" class="contentimage6">

<p>Childfirst's snack menu was developed with the guidance of a registered dietician. Our food choices are healthy and make up part of a child's daily nutritional requirements.</p>

<p>At Childfirst, snack time is a social event! Snack is available between 2:30 and 4:30 and children choose when and with whom they would like to eat. </p>

<p>They are encouraged to use good manners and to serve and clean up after themselves.</p>
